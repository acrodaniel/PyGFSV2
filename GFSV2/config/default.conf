# PLEASE NOTE: this is the default config file wherefore several
# settings are not set. If you create your own config file you can
# specify several things like date range (from/to), only downloading
# a specific month within this time range (only), a setep subset
# which should be downloaded (steps), and an areal subset given by
# lonmin/lonmax/latmin/latmax (uses wgrib2 subsetting).
 
## Date range for which the forecasts should be downloaded.
## Have to be in format YYYY-mm-dd.
#from = 2017-07-01
#to   = 2017-07-01

## Integer. If set it has to be 1-12. If 1 only January forecasts
## would be downloaded for instance.
## NOTE: this is the default config file wherefore they are not
## set here. If you create your own config file you can specify
## the date range for downloading the data.
#only = 7

## The forecast steps which have to be downloaded. List of integers.
#steps = 6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30

## For subsetting after downloading (requires wgrib2)
#lonmin = 5
#lonmax = 17
#latmin = 45
#latmax = 54

# %%Y/%%m/%%d/%%H will be replaced by the date specified.
# <type> will be replaced by the type, e.g,. c00 for control run
#        or p01/.../p10 for the perturbations. Or, if set, only
#        mean and sprd.
baseurl = ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Projects/Reforecast2/%%Y/%%Y%%m/%%Y%%m%%d%%H/<type>/latlon
# Similar for file name

# Defines the types of files which have to be downloaded if
# the [data xxxx] config "members" is TRUE or FALSE.
if_members    = c00,p01,p02,p03,p04,p05,p06,p07,p08,p09,p10
ifnot_members = mean,sprd

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# The [data xxx] blocks define what to download. 'xxx' here represents
# a parameter (or variable).
# The variable information of the GFSv2 can be found here:
# - https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/forecasts/reforecast2/README.GEFS_Reforecast2.pdf
# Last accessed: 2017-08-05, Reto.
#
# Each of these blocks has two options. 'members' is required,
# 'levels' optional and only for pressure level data. Two examples:
#
#     [data cape_sfc]
#     members = TRUE
#
# ... will download surface cape, member by member (control run and
# the ten ensemble members of the GFS reforecast v2).
#
#     [data tmp_pres]
#     members = FALSE
#     levels  = 850,700,500
#
# ... will download temperature on pressure levels, mean and spread
# only for the three levels 850/700/500 millibars or hectopascal.
# 
# NOTE: this is the default config file. The default config file
# has no data/variable definition at all. However, if you create
# a personal config file you can specify them as shown below
# (simply uncomment some of the blocks or deifne your own).
